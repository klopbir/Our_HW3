        I would like to give you information about my hobbies. I have created a simple list for you
        to illustrate my hobbies and give short information for each of them.

            <li><h3 id='items'>Playing Football:</h3>Playing footbal is one of the activities that I like most.
            I play football since I am 6. However, I do not play professionally.</li>
            <li><h3 id='items'>Swimming:</h3></li>
            In my opinion, swimming is the most satisfying activity that I have ever experienced.
            The silence of water, the feeling that you feel you are moving forward are the most fascoinating
            aspects of swimming.
            <li><h3 id='items'>Watching Movies:</h3></li>
            Watching movies is another hobby of mine, but it is not that interesting alone. Watching with someone
            (your friend, girlfriend, family) makes this activity much more interesting.
