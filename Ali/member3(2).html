    <h3>WHY DID I CHOOSE ADA?</h3>
      <p id="reason">There are several reasons to choose <em>ADA University</em>. One of them is career
    opportunities which is mandatory for me. Second one is social life in this university. Social life is very wide
    and attractive. ADA provides students with different activities, seminars, webinars, and so on. The last reason is a little bit different
   than others. ADA one of the leader universities in Azerbaijan, and if you are ADA student you will have a chance to study abroad at least for a semester.
   Furthermore, almost every company all over the world accepts a diploma from ADA while hiring employees.</p>

  <h3>SCHOOL</h3>
  <p id="reason">Beacuse of I live in Mir Jalal, 9th microdistrict, I studied at school nearby. I studied <a href="https://bakimektebleri.edu.az/267/" class='schoolname'>school number 267</a> from 1st grade till 7th grade. From the half
  of 7th grade, till the end of school I studied at <a href="https://bakimektebleri.edu.az/240/az/about_us/" class='schoolname'>school number 240</a>. I changed my school because I thought that the education at 240 is better and I did not want to ruin my
  most important school years at school number 267. If you want to get further information about my schools, you can get it just by clicking on their names.</p>
